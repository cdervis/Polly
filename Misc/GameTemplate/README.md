# Polly Game Template

## Introduction

This is a game template for Polly, a minimal 2D game framework for C++.

To build your game, simply open it in an IDE or editor that supports CMake,
such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

The CMake script will fetch and build Polly automatically.
